# Assignment 7 Movies

Build a read-only movie listing app using the Movie Database API. This app should talk to the live API to show movies and the ability to see their details. You'll need to make decisions on the following:

How to organize the source code of your app and separate concerns.
What network library to use, if any.
How will you map the JSON from the API to your model.
How will you asynchronously download and display the images.
How will you handle rotating the phone between portrait and landscape.
CocoaPods vs Carthage (iOS only).
